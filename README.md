# Key Value Store DNS Server

This is a DNS Server that uses one of three Key Value Databases (Cassandra is a Column Database but we use it as if) as a DNS Resource Record Backend to answer queries.

This application uses Redis, Cassandra or Etcd to store the RRs in a distributed fashion. This allows us to have atomic updates for each record, easy RR distribution accross a datacenter or multiple datacenters and reliability. 

TODO: DNSSec, Zone Transfer.

## Ì€`Disclaimer`

Currently a **Work in Progress**. Intended as a research application.

## System requirements

Since the application is meant to be backend distributed with a single entrypoint you need at least 3 machines.

On the main machine:
* Go 1.14
* Ansible via python or package manager
* An SSH Key

On each machine:
* SSH-Server
* The following ports, which you can configure on the ansible inventory/group_vars
  * Redis: 7001,7002,7003,7004,7005,7006 and 17001,17002,17003,17004,17005,17006 since Redis uses "server port + 10" for intercluster gossip.
  * Cassandra: 7000, 9042, 9160
  * Etcd: 2380, 2379

Ansible will compile each database on the system checking for the system requirements.

## Setup

First to set up the databases you need to have remote access to the remote machines and sudo access. 
The connection assumes the following:
* You have added your public key to the remote servers.
* The same user is present on every system.
* You have root privileges for each user.

Then you need to add your servers to the Ansible inventory. Go over to scripts/inventory/hosts and modify your IP addresses and ports if the default ports are already in use. Add the IP port:combination to the Makefile variables and the database name.

To Build
```shell
$ make build
```

To start the server 
```shell
$ make run
```
Ansible will prompt you asking for the sudo password to install the db on the remote servers.
